Description:
    The 'picolena' command creates a new documents search engine,
    indexing directories specified as parameters.
    A default structure will be created in 'picolena' directory.
    Since picolena is Rails-based, you can launch the search-engine
    web-server just like you would with any Rails application.

Example:
    picolena ~/shared_documents /media/literature
    cd picolena
    ruby script/server

    This would create the picolena file structure, index every file
    inside ~/shared_documents and /media/literature, and launch a
    web-server available at http://localhost:3000
