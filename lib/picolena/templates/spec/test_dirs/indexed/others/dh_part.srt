17
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,463
Just found this note|in my mailbox.

18
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:52,465
Says you're retiring?|What the hell?

19
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,801
Yes, ma'am. It's true.

20
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,403
Now why would you want to do|something stupid like that?

21
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,405
My doc says|I got a bum ticker,

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,874
have to take it easy|from now on.


24
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:07,080
I'm on a plane to Waikiki.|- Well, this is very annoying.

25
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:10,350
Who's gonna fix my water heater|when it breaks?

26
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:13,319
Oh, I met this young guy|named Toby.

27
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:16,322
Very bright, just turned 30.|He'll take care of you.


29
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:20,326
I am not comfortable|with strangers in my house.

30
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:24,263
<i>Took me ten years to trust you.|- I know.</i>

31
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,567
Most of those guys leave tools|and nails all over the place.

32
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,569
You never leave a mess.

33
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:31,337
Thank you, ma'am.

34
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,706
Have you told everyone else|you're leaving?

35
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:36,843
I left copies of that same note|in everybody's mailbox.

36
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,578
Well, that's not right.

37
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:41,347
After all these years, people|will want to say good-bye,

38
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:44,217
and... you know, maybe throw you|a party or somethin'.

39
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,186
Oh, no. I prefer to go quietly,|if you know what I mean.

40
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,188
I don't want a big fuss.
42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,361
There will never be|another one like you.

44
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:04,404
<i>for the very last time.</i>

498
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,390
No, no.

499
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:43,392
No, it can't be Friday,

500
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:46,395
because, remember, we agreed|that we would start next week?

501
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,714
So again, thank you so much|for this opportunity.
