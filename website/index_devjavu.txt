= Welcome to Picolena! =


== Description == 

''Picolena'' is a lightweight [http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac ferret-powered] documents search engine written in [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on rails]:

 1. Just let Ferret index any directory you want.
 2. Enter queries on your browser to get corresponding documents in a few milliseconds.


== Examples ==
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/test Basic query]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/filetype:doc every indexed .doc]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/* every indexed file]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/LIKE%20Einstien Fuzzy query]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/LIKE%20Einstein%20NOT%20Einstein Typo tracker :)]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/málaga Accented queries thanks to UTF8 encoding]
 * [http://193.197.204.23:4000/documents/pʰəˈɹɪzɪənz some hardcore UTF-8 query!]

== Advantages ==

''Picolena'' has many advantages:

 * it can index .pdf, .doc, .docx, .odt, .xls, .ods, .ppt, .pptx, .odp, .rtf, .html and plain text files will '''full text search''', and offers a very easy way to [http://picolena.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/lib/filters add new filters] to index other filetype.
 * it is '''free''' as in ''free beer'' and as in ''free speech''
 * thanks to [http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac Ferret], it is '''very fast'''
 * it keeps your data '''private'''. By default, only the computer on which it is installed can get access to the search engine. Other IP addresses can then be added to a white list.
 * it does not phone home. This claim is somewhat easier to verify on '''your server''', with just a few lines of codes added, than on a ''Don't be evil'' [http://www.google.co.uk/enterprise/ black-box server].
 * it can be used to index any ftp, smb, ssh, webdav or local directory.
 * its user interface is available in [http://picolena.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/lang/ui English, German, Spanish and French.]

== License ==
''Picolena'', ''Ferret'' and ''Ruby on Rails'' are all released under the [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php MIT license].

== Authors ==
''Picolena'' has been created by Eric Duminil, following the idea of [http://www.methods.co.nz/ff/ Ferret Finder utility] by Stuart Rackham.

It would be totally useless without:

 * Ferret, by Dave Balmain
 * Ruby on Rails, by David Heinemeier Hansson
 * the open source community that supports those projects.




= Installation process =

''Picolena'' has been tested on [http://www.ubuntu.com Ubuntu] 7.04 and 7.10, for both Desktop and Server editions.

To install ''Picolena'', you first need [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on rails] and  [http://www.rubygems.org/ RubyGems]

== Getting files ==
{{{
svn checkout http://svn.devjavu.com/picolena/trunk Picolena
cd Picolena
}}}

== Installing dependencies ==
=== On Ubuntu ===
Install required packages and gems:
{{{
sudo rake install_dependencies:on_ubuntu
}}}

=== On Debian ===
Install required packages and gems:
{{{
sudo rake install_dependencies:on_debian
}}}

=== On Mac OS ===
Yet to be implemented and tested!

=== On Windows ===
Yet to be implemented and tested!


== Checking everything is in order ==
Copy configuration files from templates and launch rspec:
{{{
rake index:prepare_config
rake spec
}}}

Hopefully, every spec will pass and we'll be ready for the next step


== Some more configuration ==
You can now edit ''config/indexed_directories.yml'' to add new directories to be indexed, both for development and production mode.
{{{
development:
  #"first directory that should be indexed": "alias path that will be used to display 'containing directory' link"
  #"second directory that should be indexed": "alias path that will be used to display 'containing directory' link"
  #....
  #alias path could be a smb, http or ftp directory.
  "spec/test_dirs/indexed": "http://picolena.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/spec/test_dirs/indexed"
test:
  "spec/test_dirs/indexed": "http://picolena.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/spec/test_dirs/indexed"
production:
  #up to you!
}}}
The best way to index ftp, ssh, smb or webdav directories are to mount them to ''/media/whatever'', and then index ''/media/whatever''.

Finally, you can add IP addresses to ''config/white_list_ip.yml'':

{{{
# Only localhost is allowed by default, any request coming from another IP will get rejected.
# You can either add an IP address to the list:
#       - 192.168.0.37
# or an IP address range:
#       - 192.168.0.
# that will match any IP address whose first octets are 192.168.0
# If you want to allow everybody, just write:
#       Allow:
#         - all
Allow:
  - 127.0.0.1
  - 0.0.0.0
}}}

== Almost there! Creating index ==
{{{
rake index:create
}}}
or
{{{
rake index:create RAILS_ENV=production
}}}

Depending on the amount of indexed data, it can take anywhere between a few seconds and some hours.
For example, 15000 documents (out of which 50% are converted to plain text) have been indexed in 30 minutes on an Ubuntu server VM running on an old Windows server.

== Done! Launching Picolena ==
{{{
ruby script/server
}}}
Time to open your browser and [http://localhost:3000 enjoy]!
