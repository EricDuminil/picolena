h1. &#x2192; 'picolena'


h2. What

''Picolena'' is a lightweight "ferret-powered":http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac documents search engine written in "Ruby on rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ :

 1. Just let Ferret index any directory you want.
 2. Enter queries on your browser to get corresponding documents in a few milliseconds.


h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install picolena</pre>

h2. The basics

The 'picolena' command creates a new documents search engine, indexing directories specified as parameters. A default structure will be created in 'picolena' directory. Since picolena is Rails-based, you can launch the search-engine web-server just like you would with any Rails application.

 picolena ~/shared_documents /media/literature
 cd picolena
 ruby script/server

This would create the picolena file structure, index every file inside ~/shared_documents and /media/literature, and launch a web-server available at http://localhost:3000
